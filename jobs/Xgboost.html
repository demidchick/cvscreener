      <h2>Initial Screening Questions</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          Industry-standard screening questions used by hiring teams:
          <ul>
            <li>What attracted you to the Xgboost role?</li>
            <li>Walk me through your relevant experience in Data Science / Machine Learning.</li>
            <li>What's your current notice period?</li>
            <li>What are your salary expectations?</li>
            <li>Are you actively interviewing elsewhere?</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </section>

      <h2>Technical Assessment Questions</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          These questions are compiled from technical interviews and hiring manager feedback:
          <ul>
            
              <li>What is the main idea of the Xgboost algorithm?</li>
            
              <li>Can you explain how Xgboost handles missing values?</li>
            
              <li>Discuss the benefits of using Xgboost over other algorithms like Random Forest.</li>
            
              <li>How can you fine-tune hyperparameters in Xgboost?</li>
            
              <li>What are regularization parameters in Xgboost and why are they important?</li>
            
          </ul>

          Expert hiring managers look for:
          <ul>
            
              <li>Ability to explain Xgboost concepts clearly</li>
            
              <li>Demonstrated implementation of Xgboost on sample datasets</li>
            
              <li>Understanding of feature importance and model interpretation</li>
            
              <li>Proficiency in selecting hyperparameters for optimal model performance</li>
            
              <li>Application of cross-validation techniques</li>
            
          </ul>

          Common pitfalls:
          <ul>
            
              <li>Overfitting the model to the training set without proper validation</li>
            
              <li>Not explaining the trade-offs of different hyperparameters</li>
            
              <li>Failing to preprocess and clean data appropriately before modeling</li>
            
              <li>Neglecting to test model performance on unseen data</li>
            
              <li>Lack of clarity when explaining technical concepts</li>
            
          </ul>
